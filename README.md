# Cornergrocer

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

The objective assigned to me is to create a software application that can track the items for the Corner Grocer, and it should include all the features that they have asked for. In my program design, there is a class that, upon building an object, reads a given file, counts the items, and collects the data in a Map. Once this process is complete, it also writes a file as 'frequency.dat'. The class has three functions, which allow for obtaining frequency, displaying frequencies, and displaying a histogram. 

## What did you do particularly well? 

I have done an amazing job of organizing my code in a readable and well-structured format. Additionally, I have implemented input validation checks to ensure that users enter the correct input, thereby ensuring the smooth execution of the code. 

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

If I had more time, I would conduct research on coding format standards and utilize them to enhance my code. This would enable me to create code that adheres to the best practices and results in cleaner, more readable, and efficient code with minimal errors. 

## Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The most challenging aspect was writing the code to read the given file. Initially, I was confused about the usage of 'ofstream' and was unsure how to proceed. However, I referred to the previous module, i.e., Module 5, and reviewed the 5-2 assignment on working with files. After examining the code, I gained a better understanding of how it works, and as a result, my code ran successfully. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

The most important lesson that I have learned from this experience is that organization is key. Breaking down the project into manageable tasks and setting specific timeframes helped us stay on track and achieve our goals each week. When it comes to big projects, one of the most important skills to develop is time management. Through these projects and as s college student I have vastly improved our ability to work within specific timeframes. Even though the challenge of failure and stress always remains high, I have learned to account for my time for failure and view failure as a learning tool instead of a negative outcome. With our continued vigilance and attention to detail, I hope to continue to achieve excellence and success in the next semester and the rest of my educational, and professional, life. 

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

I attempted to declare variable names and add comments to my code as much as possible. Additionally, I made sure to format the code alignment appropriately.
